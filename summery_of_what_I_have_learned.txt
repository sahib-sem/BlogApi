Today, I learned about Clean Architecture, a software design principle that offers several benefits for building robust and 
maintainable applications. Here's a summary of the key points I grasped:

## Loose Coupling and SOLID Principles: 
Clean Architecture promotes loose coupling between modules, making it easier to manage changes and updates. 
It also facilitates adherence to SOLID principles, enhancing code quality and maintainability.

##Domain-Centric Design:
lean Architecture is aligned with Domain-Driven Design (DDD),
emphasizing the importance of the core domain logic.This ensures that the heart of the application, the domain model, remains
isolated and focused.

Core Project: 
At the center of Clean Architecture is the Core project, which holds the domain model, abstractions, and interfaces that define 
the essential business logic.

Project Structure:

Domain Project: This project houses the entities of the web application, which are often representations of the database tables.
Application Project: Contains the repository interfaces, providing guidelines on how to define data access and manipulation.
Web Project: Interacts with the application, serving as the entry point for user interactions.
Infrastructure: Interacts with external services and implements the necessary technical details.
Test Project: Located outside the core, it's responsible for testing the application and ensuring its correctness.
Overall, Clean Architecture promotes a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage complex projects, maintain code, and 
adapt to changing requirements. This knowledge will be valuable in designing software systems that are both flexible and focused on the
 core domain.
